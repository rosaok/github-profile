## about me
i'm a data analyst at citizens advice, and a graduate in linguistics from the university of manchester. at work i'm mostly using excel, google sheets and tableau at the moment. the project i'm working on is about streamlining monthly reporting for one of CA's services, so i'm hoping to build in solutions using code as part of that. R was my go-to for stats work throughout my degree, and i've been working through [julia silge](https://github.com/juliasilge) and [david robinson](https://github.com/dgrtwo)'s [tidy text mining with r](https://github.com/dgrtwo/tidy-text-mining) as a bit of a refresh for both R and linguistics.

## some work
* as part of my japanese studies, i put together [a website written in japanese for the UoM trans campaign](https://mojanbo.github.io/uomtrans-jp/), which i was an officer for for 2 years
* i worked on a group research project looking at multilingual online language use, culminating in a [report](http://mlm.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CMC_Lithuanian_Romanian_Facebook.pdf) published by [multilingual manchester](http://mlm.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/2021-reports/)
